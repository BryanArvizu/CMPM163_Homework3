## ABOUT
I created a particle system to emulate fire, and used the built-in noise module to distort each fire texture position, to create a more unpredictable fire pattern. Additionally, I used the built-in Unity perlin noise function to create the fire's flickering light.

The trees world space Y scale is distorted according to the music, and the color of the skybox is tinted periodically according to the music.

## Parameters
#### Fire Position Noise Frequency
Changes the frequency of the noise. Higher means values differ more and are more erratic, and lower means values are more similar and smoother. Affects how much each fire texture is displaced by.

#### Fire Light Noise Speed
Changes the speed at which the perlin noise is sampled. Higher = fast flickering.

#### Skybox Tint Strength
Changes how much the skybox is tinted green based on the music.

#### Tree Distortion Strength
Changes how much the trees are distorted additionally based on the music.
